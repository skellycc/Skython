Skython - An alternative to Python

What is Skython?

Skython is an attempt at trying to improve the Python language performance and execution behaviour
while upgrading the language with new syntax features and custom behvaiour. Since this is an experiemental
project, nothing is guaranteed to work as expected, more just to see if it can execute the instruction at all.
It is an indie project and therefore bugs are bound to occur, nothing is perfect.

Skython Architecture:

Different to Python. Compiler and a Virtual Machine, no interpreter. This language is dynamic and type hinting
is an optional feature for the programmer. Memory management and similar behvaiour is managed
by a basic garbage collector designed just to keep memory at a minimum capacity.

Compiling and Running:
Not available yet.
